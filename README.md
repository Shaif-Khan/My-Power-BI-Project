📊 Real-Time Data Visualization & Dashboarding with Power BI
SQL | Power BI | Data Cleaning | Interactive Dashboards

Hello Connections! 👋
I'm Shaif Khan, a data analyst and backend developer with an MCA from Lalit Narayan Mishra Institute of Economic Development and Social Change, Patna, Bihar, affiliated to Aryabhatta Knowledge University, Patna, Bihar.

Here’s a highlight of one of my real-time Power BI projects, where I built end-to-end interactive dashboards using over 45,000+ rows of raw sales and call center data — cleaned and analyzed using SQL + Power BI. This project reflects real-world business intelligence use cases and visual storytelling.

🧾 Project Title:
